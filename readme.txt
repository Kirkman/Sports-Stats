==========================================

INTRODUCTION

Sports Stats allows your users to check recent scores, upcoming
schedules, and team standings for NFL, NBA, NHL, and MLB.

My BBS hosts a JSON database service which provides these stats
for you. The instructions below will explain how to set it up.
It is also possible to obtain the stats yourself using included
Python scripts, but I don't recommend it (and I haven't written
instructions for that yet)


==========================================

INSTALLATION

Copy the SPORTS STATS directory into your /xtrn/ directory.

THEN...


--------------------
A. Synchronet config
--------------------

1. Launch SCFG
2. Go to External Programs > Online Programs (Doors)
3. Choose an externals section to place SPORTS STATS into.
4. Hit [enter] on a blank line to create a new item.
5. Change the following settings, leaving the rest as they are:

   Name                       Sports Stats
   Internal Code              SPORTSS
   Start-up Directory         ../xtrn/sportsstats
   Command Line               ?sportsstats.js


-------------------------
B. Stats JSON config
-------------------------

I highly recommend that you subscribe to the inter-BBS stats
service I'm hosting on my BBS. This service requires the json-client.js
library found in Synchronet v3.16. If you are running an older
version of Synchronet, this door will not work for you.

The included 'server.ini' file should already be configured, 
but if you want to double-check:

1. In the Sports Stats directory (ie /xtrn/sportsstats), open 'server.ini'
2. Edit 'server.ini' to have these values:
   host = guardian.synchro.net
   port = 10088
3. Recycle services or restart Synchronet for changes to take effect.


==========================================

RELEASE NOTES:

v0.5.1:
* Patched handling of NFL schedules during the postseason. 
  For now Sports Stats will no longer display the next week/round's schedule 
  during the postseason.


v0.5:
* Added NHL support. Sports Stats now provides data for all four major sports.


v0.4:
* This door displays scores, schedules, and standings for NFL, NBA and MLB.
  NHL support will be added later.


Future plans:
* Pick favorite teams, which will be highlighted in a different color
* Display standings by divisions, or only by leagues/conferences.
* General interface improvements


==========================================

BUG REPORTS

Sports Stats can be considered in beta. It provides regular-season data for 
all four sports, and should be functional for all Synchronet sysops. 

Please expect bugs in the handling of pre- and post-season schedules, 
especially in the NHL and NFL where I'm gathering data using my own scrapers.

If you find mistakes or bugs, please email me at the address above.



==========================================

ACKNOWLEDGMENTS:

Stats used on this door come from several sources:

* The primary source is Erik Berg's xmlstats service: https://erikberg.com/api

* I use the "nflgame" Python library by burntsushi to obtain
game data. 

* I am scraping other NFL information, such as standings and stadiums, 
from NFL.com. Similarly, I scrape all NHL information from NHL.com.

Thanks also to rswindell, mcmlxxix, deuce, echicken and many others
for their work on Synchronet's Javascript libaries, and for their
code examples. I have borrowed liberally.
